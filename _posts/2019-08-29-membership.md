### How to read Medium blog posts for free!

Note - do this at your own risk! The "Mediumship" Chrome extension (created by the author of the git repo described below) was removed from the Chrome Extension store a few months ago. There is a similar extension called "Medium Free" that is still available on the Firefox plugin store.

* Clone this git repo <https://github.com/swapagarwal/mediumship>

* Go to <chrome://extensions>. Click the "Load Unpacked" button and point to the "chrome" directory underneath the directory in which the "mediumship" repo was downloaded.

* Voila! You now have the Mediumship extension installed. Click on this while viewing a Medium post that is behind a membership wall and it will open up as readable in a new tab.

* Btw - here's a good reference on creating a chrome extension: <https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-make-a-chrome-extension>
